Reflection:

I could have defined my problems in even smaller pieces and that would have helped. Even in the areas where I think I planned well and identified what I needed, I wasn't able to execute. I really struggled to utilize all the tools we have learned and was not able to make anything work. When I wasn't able to compare values in the AssignmentGroup and LearnerSubmissions using conditionals, I struggled to use other alternatives and was not able to extract the values I needed and get them in the right place to perform the calculations. I am also really slow and often have to look back at the lectures or other resources, and I think as time went on I started to panic about what little progress I made and how much time I had left to work, and I got a bit frantic. I think I really need to spend a LOT more time practicing on smaller problems with each of the tools, and also become more confident with my understanding of how they relate and can be used together before I can be successful at this task. I also need to become better at troubleshooting. We have a ton of resources and I wasn't able to efficiently find and implement the solutions to my mistakes.
