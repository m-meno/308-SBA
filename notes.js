//1.) If an AssignmentGroup does not belong to its course (mismatching course_id), your program should throw an error, letting the user know that the input was invalid. Similar data validation should occur elsewhere within the program.
// 2.) You should also account for potential errors in the data that your program receives. What if points_possible is 0? You cannot divide by zero. What if a value that you are expecting to be a number is instead a string? 
// 3.) Use try/catch and other logic to handle these types of errors gracefully.
// 4.) If an assignment is not yet due, do not include it in the results or the average. Additionally, if the learnerâ€™s submission is late (submitted_at is past due_at), deduct 10 percent of the total points possible from their score for that assignment.
// 5.) Create a function named getLearnerData() that accepts these values as parameters, in the order listed: (CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, [LearnerSubmission]), and returns the formatted result, which should be an array of objects as described above.
// 6.) You may use as many helper functions as you see fit.
